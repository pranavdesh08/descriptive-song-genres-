# descriptive-song-genres-

There has been a lot of work done on classifying genres of musical tracks based on their features. 
However, telling the genre of a song is subjective. 
Also, a genre can be very wide to tell how song is and even though it might help the listener up to some extent 
it proves to be of no use in exactly entertaining the listeners as per their mood.
This project is motivated by the very fact that if the listeners can listen to the songs based not just on broad features 
but on descriptive features exactly aligning to their mood, they, can have a great experience.
